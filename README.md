# Development of AI model for Racing Driving Level Classification

Classifying high-skilled drivers and low-skilled drivers using data extracted from Assetto-Corsa

## Motivaiton & Social Applications

      Firstly, it helps to prevent car accidents. Researchers are trying hard to develop full autonomous driving AI, which does not require drivers' attention, still has a long way to it. Current autonomous driving AI requires drivers' full attention and it just assists drivers. However, if the driving skill of assistance system and that of drivers have a great difference? There is possible danger of accident if the driver does no manage to handle the vehicle. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the driving skill of the driver and provide them with adequate level of driving assistance system. 

      Secondly, it helps to provide driver with custrom autonomous driving AI. What if every vehicle on the has the same driving AI? I don't think people are satisfied with it, because every person has different driving habits. For example, some want to get to the destination earlier, while others prefer safe and defensive driving. 
   
      Finally, drivers can choose the vehicle that perfectly matches themselves. When buying a new car, people used to mostly consider their financial conditions. However, nowadays they more consider confortness and diverse experience that the car provides. It will be helpful to choose the right car, if it is possible to evaluate the driver's drving skills.
